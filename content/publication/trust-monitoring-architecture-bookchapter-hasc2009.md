abstract = "Service-based software can be misused by potentially untrustworthy service requestors while providing services. A service-based system is usually dynamic due to mutual collaboration among stakeholders to achieve goals, perform tasks and manage resources. However, it lacks the presence of a central authority to monitor the trustworthiness of service users. In this chapter, we propose a trust monitoring architecture, called TrAM (Trust Architecture for Monitoring) to monitor the trustworthiness of service users at run-time, facilitating the analysis of interactions from trust perspectives. Monitoring allows the enforcement of corrective actions that may protect the software by mitigating major unwanted incidents. The performance of the architecture has been evaluated by monitoring a prototype file-sharing grid."
