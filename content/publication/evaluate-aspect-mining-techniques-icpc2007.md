# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Aspect mining aims at identifying cross-cutting concerns in existing systems and therefore advocates the adaption to an aspect-oriented design. This paper presents a case study examining three existing aspect mining techniques from the literature by applying them to four different open source Java applications. We compare and evaluate the individual technique and confirm the findings of a previous study of combining different aspect mining techniques in order to get better results with less manual intervention."
